# Flow8

## Overview

Flow8 is a token streaming platform for easy continuous transactions through automation. The goal is to make continuous transactions over user-defined intervals.

In essence, the application automates various financial activities such as salaries and subscriptions, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

This automation is particularly valuable in DeFi, where efficiency and reliability are paramount.
Built on the Lisk blockchain, the application leverages the power of smart contracts to securely and efficiently handle token streaming functionalities.

By implementing this solution, the Token Streaming Application aims to improve the user experience and operational efficiency within DeFi projects. Users can enjoy seamless, uninterrupted transactions while benefiting from the security and transparency provided by blockchain technology.

Overall, the application represents a significant advancement in the DeFi landscape, promising greater convenience and accessibility for users worldwide.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Most of the major subscription services do not offer crypto as a payment option for their services.
Employers paying in crypto do not have an easy way to load addresses and automate payments.

## SOLUTION:

## Subsciption services

Our platform allows subscription services like Netflix to create their own module on the platform from where their users can subscribe to available services and automate payments.

## Salary streaming

The salary streaming makes it easy for employers to just upload a CSV with employee addresses and amounts, select the payment interval and automatic salary payment starts.

## BUSINESS LOGIC

The platform seeks to onboard existing web2 services that offer subscriptions like DSTV, Starlink, Netflix etc.

We generate income by charging both the companies and the users for making transactions through the platform.

## FUTURE PROSPECTS

We will allow more custom subscription-based services like mobile subscriptions from network providers.
Automated staking rewards and income generation for our staking pool.

## IMPLEMENTATION

Some of the tools we used for the project include:

1. Chainlink automation using upkeep.
2. Smart contracts using solidity.
3. Core blockchain testnet for deployment & interactions.
4. React and Typescript for the Frontend.
